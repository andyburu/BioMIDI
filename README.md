# BioMIDI

This a project that sends data from various biometrical sensors as MIDI commands. The goal is to build a soundscape based on the human body.

## TODO
1. Break out the Note-on-a-Scale selector from Motion dector (DONE)
2. Investigate if it's possible to use a global MIDI BPM
3. Add support for having multiple notes running at the same time
4. Turn into LV2 plugins
